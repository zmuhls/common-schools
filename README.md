# common-schools-map

## abstract

This project uses digital mapping to chart the multiple histories and spaces of common school education in New York State over the nineteenth century. In particular, my project will visualize the prelavence of the common school era by mapping these institutes in ways that are often neglected or underrepresented in formal accounts of NYS education history. I will visualize a selection of the geographic and institutional sites of the common school movement in NYS preceding the historical development of widespread state oversight. In doing so, I will build a digital map that plots common school locations, and integrates each entry with photographic and archival documentation related to the institute in question. This mapping approach allows me to constellate multiple educational histories in both locally and historically situated ways, while connecting archival and cartographic data to each of the schools in question. Ultimately, my project will consist of a common school map meant to raise visibility around the transformation of these community-led educational spaces into centralized extensions of state governance.
